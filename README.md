# CheatSheets
This repository contains a collection of cheatsheets that cover different automation tools and concepts. The goal is to provide a quick reference for small to mid-sized companies that are looking to automate their processes. This can also be helpful to those that are looking, to begin with, automation, but have no clue where to start. 

The cheatsheets cover topics such as Ansible, Jenkins, Packer, Chef, and more. They provide a brief overview of what the tool is, how it can be used, and some of the key concepts and commands. They are designed to be used as a quick reference, rather than a comprehensive guide.

By making use of these cheat sheets, you should be able to quickly get up to speed on the tools and concepts that are important for automating your processes. Whether you're new to automation or a seasoned pro, these cheat sheets should be able to help you get things done more efficiently and effectively.

In addition to the automation cheatsheets, this repository also includes cheatsheets for operating systems such as Linux and Windows. These cheat sheets cover basic commands and concepts that are important for managing and troubleshooting these operating systems. There are also cheat sheets for popular coding languages such as Python, JavaScript, and Ruby. These cheat sheets provide a quick reference for the syntax, common libraries, and best practices for working with many languages. So, this repository not only should provide information about automation tools but also provide a comprehensive guide for different operating systems and coding languages. As we continue to learn together, I will add more documentation to this repository.
