All information below is a Layer Security model I created for a Linux server hardening approach with DISA consideration. These are things I have learned over the years and you feel like adding or making changes please feel free. 

# Linux_Server_Security_Layer_Model

The focus is on Linux servers and the model follows a layered approach. Linux Server Security Layer Model (LSSLM)
# Securing a Linux Server for the Production Environment

This document outlines a layered approach to securing a Linux server in a production environment, similar to the OSI model but focused on security aspects.

## 1. Physical Security Layer

**Objective:** Protect the physical machine and its environment.

**Key Actions:**
- Secure data center access.
- Environmental controls (e.g., fire suppression, climate control).
- Hardware security (e.g., locking server racks).

## 2. Network Security Layer

**Objective:** Protect the server from network-based threats.

**Key Actions:**
- Implement firewalls to filter incoming and outgoing traffic.
- Use Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) and Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS).
- Secure network protocols (SSH for remote access, HTTPS for web traffic).

## 3. Operating System Security Layer

**Objective:** Harden the operating system against attacks.

**Key Actions:**
- Regularly update and patch the OS.
- Minimize installed packages to reduce the attack surface.
- Configure user permissions and privileges carefully.
- Use security extensions like SELinux or AppArmor.

## 4. Application Security Layer

**Objective:** Secure all applications running on the server.

**Key Actions:**
- Update and patch applications regularly.
- Implement application-level firewalls (e.g., web application firewalls).
- Conduct code reviews and security testing for custom applications.
- Isolate applications in containers or virtual machines when possible.

## 5. Data Security Layer

**Objective:** Protect data stored and processed by the server.

**Key Actions:**
- Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit.
- Implement strong access controls and authentication mechanisms.
- Regularly backup data and ensure the integrity of backups.
- Use data loss prevention (DLP) strategies.

## 6. Monitoring and Response Layer

**Objective:** Detect, log, and respond to security incidents.

**Key Actions:**
- Implement logging and monitoring tools (e.g., SIEM systems).
- Regularly review logs for suspicious activity.
- Develop and test incident response plans.
- Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing.

## 7. Policy and Compliance Layer

**Objective:** Ensure adherence to security policies and regulatory requirements.

**Key Actions:**
- Develop clear security policies and procedures.
- Train staff on security best practices and awareness.
- Conduct regular compliance audits.
- Implement policy enforcement mechanisms.

### Implementation Example: SSH Hardening

**Context:** As part of the Operating System Security Layer.

**Actions:**
- Disable root login over SSH (`PermitRootLogin no` in `sshd_config`).
- Use key-based authentication instead of passwords.
- Change the default SSH port to reduce automated attacks.
- Implement rate limiting and fail2ban to block repeated unauthorized attempts.

## 8. DISA STIG Recommendations

**Objective:** Align server security practices with DISA STIGs to meet or exceed DoD security requirements.

**Overview:**
- DISA STIGs provide detailed guidelines for securing information systems and software that might be vulnerable to attacks.
- They cover various aspects, including operating systems, network components, and application security.

**Key Actions:**
- Review and implement relevant STIGs for the Linux operating system and other software components on the server.
- Regularly check for updates to STIGs, as they are periodically revised.
- Automate compliance checking and reporting where possible using tools like OpenSCAP.
- Document any deviations from STIG recommendations and provide justifications for waivers or exceptions.

**Note:** While STIGs are designed for DoD systems, they are publicly available and can be used by any organization to enhance security. However, some recommendations might be overly stringent for certain environments, so it's important to evaluate their applicability based on your specific requirements and risk profile.

Each layer in this model addresses specific aspects of server security, and they work together to create a comprehensive security posture. It's important to regularly review and update each layer's strategies to adapt to evolving threats and technologies.
